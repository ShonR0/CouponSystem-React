Hello World!!!

This is my final project in 'Java Fullstack Developer' course in John Bryce.
The project is a E-Commerce website for purchasing all kinds of cupons, all written in ReactJs using complex libraries such as Redux and Axios.

The website also contains fully developed backend server written in Spring for maintaining customers and companies users and their coupons.
